 Write-up on the approach taken for UI design 
---
The key points that were kept in mind was to have an app that was simple yet functional. While designing an app, it is important to remember that inorder for a lot of people to like and use an app, it must be aesthetically pleasing without over complicating it. The app that I've made ,Toshair revolves around this core concept. The UI is designed using Figma,which is a powerful tool for designing the user interface for mobile applications. The color scheme used for the login page is vibrant as the first impression is always the best. The rest of the app is based on a colour combination of white, shades of blue and yellow. They are all contrary colours and make the UI aestheticlly pleasing. The app is extremly easy to navigate and has simple button placements to avoid accidental tapping and confusion. This app is a simple yet powerful microblogging application with features such as liking, commenting, sharing, publishing, and an explore tab to help users find a post of their choice. Furthermore, there is also an added feature of a recommendation section.
